//You are given two strings s and t.
//String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
//Return the letter that was added to t.

//Examples

//Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
//Output: "e"
//Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

//Input: s = "", t = "y"
//Output: "y"

//Constraints:
//0 <= s.length <= 1000
//t.length == s.length + 1
//s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

//Solution

var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
    const set1 = s.split('').sort();
    const set2 = t.split('').sort();
    
    for(let i = 0; i < set2.length; i++){
        if(set1[i] !== set2[i]){
            return set2[i]
        }
    }
